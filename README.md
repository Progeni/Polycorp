# Polycorp
This repo holds the source code for the Poly Computer ROMs and Operating System.  It came from a collection of disks donated to us by an ex-employee of Progeni (i.e. Polycorp).  This is the original commented source code, it is not a dissassembly.


What versions of the Operating System (POLYNET.SYS) have we seen (the 1891 type is in the fle, not my typo):

OPSYS - Version 0.2.2 - May 1891

OPSYS - Version 3.0.0 - Jun 1982

OPSYS - Version 3.2.0 - Jul 1983

OPSYS - Version 3.4.0 - Nov 1984
