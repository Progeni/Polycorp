# Polycorp
This repo holds the source code for the Poly Computer ROMs and Operating System.  It came from a collection of disks donated to us by an ex-employee of Progeni (i.e. Polycorp).  This is the original commented source code, it is not a dissassembly.


Versions of the Server (Proteus) Operating System (POLYNET.SYS) we've seen (the 1891 typo is in the file, not my typo):

* OPSYS - Version 0.2.2 - May 1891
* OPSYS - Version 3.0.0 - Jun 1982
* OPSYS - Version 3.2.0 - Jul 1983
* OPSYS - Version 3.4.0 - Nov 1984

Versions of the BASIC interpreter we've seen:

* POLYBASIC V2.3
* POLYBASIC V3.0
* POLYBASIC V3.1
* POLYBASIC V3.4

Versions of the POLY BIOS are inconsistently versioned.  Most recently they used he build date located at the start of ROM.  We've seen:

* 831122 (Version 3.4 standalone with disk drive attached)
* 830519 (Verison 3.4 with networking)
* V3.1 (Vesion 3.1 for Poly 2)
* And other versions (Version 2.3, Version 3.0)

Versions of POLYSYS.SYS (Poly) appear to have non-sequential version numbers - we're still trying to understand how it worked.
